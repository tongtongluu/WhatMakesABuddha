# WhatMakesABuddha

## Key Question answered
How many features must a Buddha has, before you call him Buddha?

## Concept
In Buddhism art, the image of the historical Buddha is often labeled “Shakyamuni”. This distinguishes the image of the historical Buddha, or cosmic buddhas, bodhisattvas, or other divine beings. Buddha images vary greatly from place to place and period to period, but they almost always show some conventional features. So this interactive piece aims to visualize those universal features that a Buddha contains. The bubble groups give you an idea of the Buddhism art collections from the Smithsonian.  By using a 3D sculpture, I want to mimic an immersive experience like you are standing inside a museum, like the National Museum of Asian Art, Smithsonian.
